# ðŸŒ™ Luccas's Neovim Configuration

This is my personal Neovim setup, configured entirely in Lua. It's designed to be a fast, modern, and efficient environment for development, managed with `lazy.nvim`.

## ðŸ”‘ Keybindings

The leader key is set to `<Space>`.

All keybindings for this configuration are defined in the `lua/luccas/remap.lua` file.

To easily discover and search all custom mappings, this configuration includes a custom keymap viewer built with Telescope.
* Press `<leader>?` (`Space` + `?`) in Normal mode to open it.
* You can then start typing to filter by plugin, group, or description.
